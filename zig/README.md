Opinion: I mean, I understand why Zig does not manage strings by itself, as the statement of Zig:
> (..) Zig does not have hidden control flow..

But also, it complicates things. I mean, it is not the hardest as it is almost identical to how you manage strings in C but, I'd appreciate a library, even if it is not in the standard library, but also provided by the Zig team to manage strings. Sometimes, managing strings can become cumbersome. I guess I'll end up developing my own -\_/-
